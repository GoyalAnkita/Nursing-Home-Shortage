Visualization of Nursing Home Shortage

Please find the link of the Google Site where the visualizations have been arranged.The visualizations are done in Tableau.The following two scenarios have been visualized:

1)Conduct a state level analysis on shortage of aides, clinical staff, nursing staff
and other staff

2)Conduct a state level analysis on availability of eye protection, gloves, hand
sanitizer, N95 masks, surgical masks, and ventilator supplies

Note: Before doing the visualization the data was properly formatted and arranged using Pandas and Numpy library.
